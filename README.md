###Course Description

Foundational course in data science, including machine learning theory, case studies and real-world examples, introduction to various modeling techniques, and other tools to make predictions and decisions about data. Students will gain practical computational experience by running machine learning algorithms and learning how to choose the best and most representative data models to make predictions. Students will be using Python throughout this course.


### Completion Requirements

You can always reach out to Daniel by phone or email if you have any inquiries about enrollment, payments, graduation requirements or questions about how to get to know other students.  
General Assembly's Part-time courses are pass/fail programs.  We have certain requirements in order to be considered a graduate of our programs:

1. Missing no more than **2 class sessions** over the duration the course.
2. Completing **80% of assigned homework**
3. **Completing the final project**


### Python Resources [By Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT7)
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python 2.7x Reference Guide](https://github.com/justmarkham/python-reference/blob/master/reference.py): Kevin's beginner-oriented guide that demonstrates a ton of Python concepts through short, well-commented examples.
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.
